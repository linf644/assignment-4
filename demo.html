					If all the players guess out the word, the people who draw doesn’t get a point.</li>

					If there’s only one player who can’t figure out what the word is, the drawer will get the highest point in that turn.</li>
					<li>
					The person who guess out the word first gets the most point.</li>
					<li>
					The highest point that the players can get is determined by the numbers of players, e.g. if there are 8 players, the highest point the players can get will  be 8.</li>
