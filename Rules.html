						<ul>
							<li>
						Two players take turns drawing a picture to convey the guess word for their partner to guess. The person drawing is provided three random words, ranked by difficulty, earning one to three points if their partner guesses correctly.<br></li>
						<li>After the player has finished drawing, the guesser will view a stroke by stroke replay of the drawing, without the pauses in between. The guesser is given a blank space for typing the guess. The guesser gets unlimited tries and limited time to enter the guess word. The drawer gets an opportunity to watch their partner guess the drawing as it is replayed.</li>
